🧠 Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model is designed to classify transactions as fraudulent or legal, improving platform security.

Model Highlights:
Algorithms used: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost

Handles imbalanced classes with data balancing techniques

Evaluated using ROC-AUC, F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall

📊 Data
The dataset includes transaction-related features such as:

Transaction amount, time, device information

Encoded categorical features like browser type, source, sex, and country

Features related to signup and purchase times

Preprocessing steps:

Outlier detection and removal

Feature normalization

Handling class imbalance to improve model fairness

🌟 Best Practices
Data Security: Maintain privacy for sensitive transaction data.

Model Updates: Periodically retrain the model with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

Documentation: Keep the project documentation current for ease of collaboration.

❓ FAQ
Q: What is the goal of this project?
