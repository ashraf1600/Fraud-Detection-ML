# Machine Learning Model
The core of this project is a machine learning model that classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, providing a proactive layer of defense against online fraud.

## Highlights:

Utilizes powerful algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.

Tackles class imbalance through data balancing and sampling techniques.

Evaluated rigorously with metrics like ROC-AUC, F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure robustness.

# 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains features relevant to transactional behavior, including:

Transaction details: Amount, time, and device information.

Categorical data: Browser type, source, sex, and country encoded for model use.

Signup & purchase timing: Day and month attributes to capture temporal patterns.

## Preprocessing includes:

Outlier detection and removal.

Feature scaling and normalization.

Handling class imbalance to improve fairness and detection power.

## 🌟 Best Practices
Data Privacy: Always maintain confidentiality of sensitive transactional data.

Model Maintenance: Retrain models periodically to adapt to emerging fraud trends.

Documentation: Keep documentation clear and up to date to facilitate collaboration.
